# NFTGenAI 🎨

Generate unique and simple NFT images using NFTGenAI, a tool created with the guidance of OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## 🌟 Features

- Generate 10,800 unique images visualized as parallel universes.
- Randomly positioned and colored lines and circles.
- Easy-to-use and modify Python script.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow library: Install it with pip:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NFTGenAI.git
```
2. Navigate to the NFTGenAI directory:
```bash
cd NFTGenAI
```
3. Run the SpectralMandala.py script:
```bash
python SpectralMandala.py
```
4. Find the generated images in the 'SpectralMandala' directory.

## 🧠 Code Overview

- The script first ensures the output directory `SpectralMandala` exists.
- It uses predetermined parameters for the number of images, dimensions, and elements per image.
- Within a loop, it generates the images with random lines and circles.
- Each image is sequentially saved in the output directory.

## 🛠️ Customization

Feel free to modify the number of images, dimensions, or elements to suit your needs. Additional shapes and elements can also be added to the script to enhance complexity and uniqueness.
